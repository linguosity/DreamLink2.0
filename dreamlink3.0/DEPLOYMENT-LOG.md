# Dreamlink Development & Deployment Log

## Project Overview
Dreamlink is a dream journal application built with Next.js 15, Supabase, and OpenAI integration for dream analysis. This document traces our development process and the solutions we implemented to overcome various challenges.

## Initial Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Next.js 15 & React 19 Module Resolution Issues

**Problem:**
```
Module not found: Can't resolve 'private-next-rsc-mod-ref-proxy'
```

**Root Cause:**
This was a dependency issue related to Next.js 15.1.7 and React 19. The "private-next-rsc-mod-ref-proxy" module is an internal module for Next.js React Server Components.

**Solution:**
- Added webpack fallbacks for native modules in next.config.js:
  ```javascript
  webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
    if (!isServer) {
      config.resolve.fallback = {
        ...config.resolve.fallback,
        bufferutil: false,
        'utf-8-validate': false,
      };
    }
    return config;
  }
  ```
- Fixed the useFormStatus hook import to use it from react-dom instead of next/navigation, as per React 19 documentation

### 2. Supabase Authentication Issues

**Problem:**
Authentication failures with error messages like "Auth session missing!" in production.

**Root Cause:**
Incorrect cookie handling implementation in Supabase SSR client configuration.

**Solution:**
Implemented the official Supabase SSR pattern for Next.js 15:
- Updated server-side client with proper getAll/setAll methods
- Fixed client-side browser client implementation
- Corrected middleware cookie handling
- Added proper redirect URL configuration in Supabase settings

### 3. Vercel Deployment Issues

**Problem:**
Deployments failing with root directory issues.

**Root Cause:**
Incorrect project configuration in Vercel dashboard, where it was looking for a nested directory that didn't exist.

**Solution:**
- Removed the incorrect root directory setting in Vercel project settings
- Created a deployment script to automate the process
- Added proper environment variable handling
- Configured redirect for auth callback

### 4. Dream Analysis OpenAI Integration

**Problem:**
Inconsistent dream analysis results and formatting issues.

**Root Cause:**
Based on investigating the OpenAI API implementation, there were several issues:
- Error handling was insufficient
- JSON parsing of results was inconsistent
- Response format was not properly structured

**Solution:**
The latest commit (`25d06f2`) includes significant improvements:
- Updated API route to return consistent data format
- Added explicit server-side rendering protection
- Replaced unnecessary refresh calls with direct API calls
- Added proper handling of API responses
- Implemented comprehensive error handling
- Structured the OpenAI API response for consistent parsing

## Deployment Process

The deployment process now involves:

1. **Supabase Configuration**:
   - Setting the correct site_url in config.toml
   - Configuring proper redirect URLs for authentication
   - Pushing database changes with `supabase db push`

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
   - SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET
   - OPENAI_API_KEY

3. **Vercel Deployment**:
   - Using `vercel --prod` for production deployments
   - Ensuring correct project configuration (no nested directory)
   - Setting environment variables in Vercel dashboard

The application is now successfully deployed at:
- https://dreamlink3-0.vercel.app/

## Current Status & Next Steps

The application is working correctly with the following features:
- User authentication with Supabase
- Dream journal entries with CRUD operations
- AI-powered dream analysis via OpenAI integration
- Social sharing of dream interpretations
- Mobile-responsive design

Potential next steps could include:
- Refining the OpenAI prompt for more relevant biblical analyses
- Adding more visualization features for dream patterns
- Implementing advanced search capabilities
- Adding user preferences for analysis categories
